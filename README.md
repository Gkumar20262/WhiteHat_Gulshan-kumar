FRONTEND
 
 Web;
 
 -React JS:
 ReactJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is maintained by Facebook and a community
 of individual developers and companies. It is widely used as a base in building single-page websites and mobile applications. It is
 very easy to use, and it allows users to create reusable UI components.
 
 -Tailwind Css:
 Tailwind CSS is a design system implementation in pure CSS. It is also configurable. 
 It gives developers super powers. It allows them to build websites with a clean consistent UI out of the box.
 It integrates well with any web dev framework because it‘s just CSS! 
  
 -Google Analytics:
 Google Analytics is the premier analytics platform for tracking site or app performance. It is part of a range of tools provided by 
 Google that include Google Search Console and Google Tag Manager.The platform provides you with a full picture of how your site is
 performing. It collects a vast amount of data and processes it intelligently. It then generates reports to display that data to you.
 Those reports are what you can use to gain critical insight into your site and the people who visit it.
 
 Mobile;
 
 -React Native:
 React Native is an open source JavaScript Mobile framework from Facebook specially designed to build native mobile apps for iOS and 
 Android. React Native is based on   ReactJS JavaScript library that helps to build the user interface for mobile platforms.
 React Native can be directly used inside an existing IOS or android app or you can build a native app right from scratch. At present
 React Native is used with some popular apps like Facebook mobile app, Instagram, Pinterest, Skype, etc.
 
 CLOUD
 
  Aws:
 Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured
 services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading
 government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster
 
  Google Cloud:
 Google Cloud consists of a set of physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual resources, such as virtual 
 machines (VMs), that are contained in Google's data centers around the globe. Each data center location is in a region. Regions are
 available in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Each region is a collection of zones, which are isolated
 from each other within the region. Each zone is identified by a name that combines a letter  identifier with the name of the region.
 
 BACKEND
  
  Node JS:
 Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
 Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
 A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O 
 primitives in its standard library  that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using
 non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
 
  Firebase:
 Google Firebase is a web and mobile application development platform that provides services and tools to develop dynamic and responsive
 apps. -Firebase not only gives  a framework to create the apps, but also has powerful tools to improve the quality of the app and
 enhance business. -Firebase offers a real-time database as a back-end service.
 
  MongoDB:
 MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional
 relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit
 of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables.
